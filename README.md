# Server Side Programming - Spring 2020 Final Project

Final Project for the Spring 2020, Server Side Programming class at the University of Central Missouri. This is a Pizza Shop called Pizza Bob's. There is a home page that hosts
the sites logo, along with a navigation bar that allows the user to look at the menu and place an order. You can also view the orders that have been placed in the view orders tab.
The menu is generated from the mysql database under the ZGF_PB_Pizzas table. All orders are tracked in the ZGF_PB_Orders table. Both tables are hosted on the cs.ucmo.edu/phpMyAdmin
server.

## Getting Started

Download the project into the xampp htdocs folder on your computer. Make sure Xampp is running and running the apache services.
